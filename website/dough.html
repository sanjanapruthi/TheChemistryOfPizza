		  <h1>What is it?</h1>
		  <p>Flour is made with barley, buckwheat, corn, lima beans, oats, peanuts, potatoes, soybeans, rice and rye.</p>

			  <h1>Gluten in Flour</h1>
			  <p>Flour contains high levels of glutenin and gliadin protein called gluten. Adding water creates a network by hydrogen bonds and disulfide links. Kneading the flour strengthens the network of proteins. </p>
			  <p>Oxidizing agents, like potassium bromate, chlorine dioxide, azodicarbonamide, primarily affect sulfur-containing amino acids, ultimately helping to form disulfide bridges between the gluten molecules. The addition of these agents to flour will create a stronger dough.</p>

			  <h1>Startches in Flour</h1>
			  <p>Flour also contians starches: long chains of connected sugar molecues. Yeast converts this to glucose which is used in fermentation.</p>

			  <h1>White Color of Flour</h1>
			  <p>A bleaching agent is also added called benzoyl peroxide to make the flour more white. Bleaching flour leads to the loss of many beneficial nuetrients.</p>

				<h1>What is it?</h1>
				<p>The yeast organisms expel carbon dioxide as they feed off of sugars. </p>
				<p>While at room temperature, the alcohol is liquid, but when the bread hits the oven, the alcohol begins to evaporate, transforming into gas bubbles that contribute to the rise of your bread. Given the amount of alcohol formed during fermentation, of course ethanol helps bread rise.</p>
				<br>
			</div>

			<div>
				<img src="gluten.jpg" width="200" height="150" vspace="50">
				<h1>What contributes to the density of the dough?</h1>
				<p>As the bread dough sits in the fridge for hours and hours, enzymes in the flour slowly break down the gluten proteins into smaller pieces. Those smaller pieces can more easily assemble into a network and form gluten (a combination of the gliadin and glutenin molecules). Gluten plays a crucial role in bread rise, trapping the bubbles of gas, and yeast has an impact on the development of gluten.</p>
			</div>

			<h1>How do you make the dough more tasty?</h1>
			<p>If you want the best-tasting dough, let the dough rise longer than normal.</p>
			<p>Yeast is supposed to make carbon dioxide, and actually, they make ethanol with that carbon dioxide. But when you let them work longer than they should, they start making mistakes and those mistakes are flavor molecules. The longer rise time helps a lot with flavor development.</p>

				<h1>What is it?</h1>
				<p>Minerals dissolved in water (mostly magnesium and calcium) can help proteins in the flour bond together more tightly, forming a stronger gluten structure, the network of interconnected proteins that give dough its strength and elasticity.</p>
				<p>Water with a high concentration of dissolved minerals makes for better cooking. Water that passes through a lot of limestone tends to taste more bitter because of its higher calcium content.</p>
			</div>

			<h1>How does the water acidity affect the dough?</h1>
			<p>Since yeast is an acid loving organism, it does best in a lower pH environment, so the high pH of alkaline water can slow down the yeast activity and result in dough that doesnâ€™t rise properly.</p>

	    	<h1>What role does salt play in dough?</h1>
	    	<p>Salt stabilizes the yeast fermentation rate, strengths the dough, enhances the flavor, and increases dough mixing time. </p>

			<h1>Fermentation Rate</h1>
			<p>In dough without salt, the rate of fermentation occurs rapidly, releasing gas very fast leading to a sour taste with poor texture. Salt slows the process down as a result of osmotic pressure on the membrane of the yeast cells. This concept makes salt a tool to control the speed of the processes. </p>

				<h1>Enhancing flavor</h1>
				<p>The alkaloid chemical compound piperine creates the pungency.</p>
				<br>
			</div>

			<h1>Strengthening dough</h1>
			<p>At a normal flour pH (about 6.0), the gluten protein has a net positive charge. These charges repel each other and keep the protein changes from interacting. Adding salt shields the charges allowing the protein chains to approach each other, forming a stronger dough.  </p>

				<h1>Why is pizza greasy?</h1>
				<p>Oil and water don't mix because water (polar) molecules are more attracted to each other than to oil molecules (non-polar)</p>
				<p>Since oil will not mix into water, when we use oil in our dough, it helps to impede the migration of moisture from the sauce and toppings into the dough both prior to baking.</p>
			</div>

			<h1>How does it help with the elasticity?</h1>
			<p>Oil also acts as a lubricant in the dough, making it easier to stretch or sheet out in the forming process. </p>

			<h1>How does it work?</h1>
			<p>When food is added to hot oil, its surface dehydrates, forming a crust that inhibits further oil absorption. The starch dries into crisp shell and protects the moisture beneath. The food inside steams while simultaneously browning and crispening the outside. </p>

			<h1>Maillard Reaction</h1>
			<p>The Maillard Reaction is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned food its distinctive flavor. </p>
			<p>The Maillard reaction, often referred to as browning, occurs when proteins undergo a chemical reaction with reducing sugars upon applied heat. More specifically, proteins, peptides and the free amino groups of amino acids react with free reducing sugars to produce desirable flavors, aroma, and crust coloring. </p>
