		  <h1>The most popular pizza topping!</h1>
		  <p>Pepperoni is on 35% of all pizza orders. Its color and ability to maintain its structure after being cooked are what makes it so appealing.</p>
		  <p>Pepperoni is a dry sausage, which means it isn't cooked. Instead, it's cured and fermented. </p>
		  <h1> How it's made </h1>
		  <p>First, pork and beef are mashed and mixed together with various spices and flavorings. </p>
		  <p>Then, curing agents such as salt and sodium nitrite are added to prevent the growth of unwanted microorganisms, and lactic acid bacteria is added.</p>

		  <p>The meat is then stuffed into casings, which are often made of cellulose </p>
		  <h1>Fermentation </h1>
		  <p>Over the next two or three days the ground meat undergoes fermentation inside the casings. Lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, causing the meat’s pH to drop and preserving the meat. </p>
		  <h1> Preservation </h1>
		  <p>Then, the sausages spend the next twelve to twenty days in a drying room to reduce the moisture level </p>
		  <p> After drying, the pepperoni is sliced, packaged, and shipped to supermarkets and restaurants where it can make its way onto our pizzas and subs. </p>

		  <p> Bromelain is an enzyme with inflammatory properties. This is what causes the prickly feeling in your mouth when you eat pineapples. When pineapples are cooked, the enzyme denatures and does not have the same affect.</p>
		  <h1> Sweet and Salty</h1>
		  <p> Pineapple contains sugars such as sucrose, giving it a sweet flavor. Meanwhile, pizzas contain tomatoes, which have a more salty flavor. This combination of sweet and salty is what makes pineapple pizza so delicious.</p>

			<h1>What type of mushroom should you use?</h1>
			<p>There are many kinds of mushrooms found on pizza, the most common is the "common mushroom" or the "white mushroom". The scientific name of this mushroom isAgaricus bisporus</p>
			<h1>Why do you need to cook mushrooms before putting them on pizza?</h1>
			<p>As any pizza chef would tell you, never use raw mushrooms on a pizza. Mushrooms contain a high water content, so when they are heated up, they begin to lose water, but don't start to actually cook yet. The time it takes a pizza to cook is nowhere enough time for the mushrooms to cook completely.</p>
			<p>Therefore, if you plan on putting mushrooms on your pizza, it is recommended to saute them before hand.</p>

			<h1>Why are they so spicy?</h1>
			<p>Jalapeños contain a molecule called capsaicin, which is what makes them so spicy. </p>
			<img src="toppingpics/cap.png" style="width:300px;height:150px;padding:5px 50px; float:center">

			<p>When jalapeño plants are stressed, as when they are lacking water, the capsaicin increases resulting in hotter peppers, and hotter pizzas.</p>
			<h1>pH?</h1>
			<p>Jalapeños are a high-acid food with a pH of 4.8-6.0</p>

		<div class="descriptions">
			<h1>Why do chopped onions make you cry?</h1>
			<p>Lachrymatory-factor synthase is released into the air when we cut an onion.</p>
			<p>The synthase enzyme converts the amino acids sulfoxides of the onion into sulfenic acid.</p>
			<p>The unstable sulfenic acid rearranges itself into syn-ropanethial-S-oxide.</p>
			<p>Syn-propanethial-S-oxide gets into the air and comes in contact with our eyes. The lachrymal glands become irritated and produces the tears!</p>

			<h1> What happens when you cook onions?</h1>
			<p>When onions are cooked, the enzyme is denatured, so onions on pizza won't make you cry! </p>
